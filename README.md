🛠️ How It Works

1. User submits a URL.
2. The system checks:
   - If the URL uses HTTPS
   - If it contains suspicious patterns (e.g., IP address or URL shorteners)
   - If the domain is reputable (based on static checks)
3. An AI model provides a plain-language explanation.
4. A trust score is displayed along with the result.
